##The Importance of HTML Semantics and Validation

Semantics has always been a word about the meaning of language and HTML application of the word parallels that meaning. Naturally this means that the elements I create in an HTML document should  have inherent meaning corresponding to the tags I choose. If there are more ways than one to accomplish something in HTML, then what makes me choose a certain tag? The utility of the content should indicate the best tag to use.
The dilemma appears when CSS is added and styles over the HTML. It would seem to render useless the effort put forth in making your HTML document make semantic sense. There are reasons, though, why the best practice is to keep HTML semantically kosher.

Robots will still read the HTML, and they will understand more when the semantics are appropriate. Google searches will, for example, be more likely to extrapolate the important information when entered under a heading tag. Even though CSS might style a heading to be not as visually important, the mark up is what the robots will read.

Readability is another reason to make sure HTML makes sense semantically. This is the obvious reason to me. Interpreting a viscous, sticky mess of an HTML document is not something anyone wants to do. Even for your own purposes, bad readability will slow you down when styling later on.

This was a good article on the subject and also mentions that other "user agents" will be more likely to understand HTML if the mark up is semantic. This will enhance the document's ability to be read not only by browsers across platforms, but in the future as well.

Much like semantics, validating HTML provides additional benefits that might not be immediately apparent. Other than the obvious benefit of checking for errors and being able to fix the ones that are vital for allowing a browser to make everything work, validation can enforce standards that make a website appear professional to other developers, make collaborations smoother, and also make maintaining easier.

As with any language or discipline that has syntax and formatting rules, there are best ways to practice using HTML. In past lives, I've experienced a similar phenomenon when writing music!
